  My impressions about learned material
  
  First of all a have to express my gratitude to this course, because sometimes it's quite difficult to find such a userful content in free access.
  I've never thought that git is so flexible and provides a huge amount of tools to work with data. Time after time i faced a tacks whi—Åh reqired a lot of time and 
  mental efforts to complete, but i am so glad that i received this information and opportunity to check my knowlages by passing a tests.

I've learned a lot of commands to use in Linux CLI. It makes my job easier and i believe that each newbie must make a habit to use them even when he have to create a directory! It's true programmer way. 
Also i partly found out how does the HTTP works, this topic was totally new for me, and i will return to this piont later.

I've learned a lot about forking, branching, rebasing, merging and so on. It was really interesting to me the ability to push one branch to another. I found out a difference between git-commands 'reset', 'amend' and 'revert'. I've already started to use this commands at the elementary level.
